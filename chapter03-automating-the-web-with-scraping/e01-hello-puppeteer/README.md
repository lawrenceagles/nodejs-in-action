# e01 &mdash; Hello Puppeteer!
> A collection of Puppeteers basic techniques 

# Description
Puppeteer is a Node.js library which provides a way to control Chrome/Chromiun by code.

This project illustrates a few of the most basic techniques you can use with Puppeteer:
* generating a PNG screenshot of a web page
* generating a PDF screenshot of a web page
* launching Full Chromium (instead of headless which is the default)
* generate a screenshot without images (by blocking image loading)
* interact with a web page by typing on a search box (this example no longer works, but the techniques are still valid)
