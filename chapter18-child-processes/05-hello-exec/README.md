# 05-hello-exec
> executing a non-Node application, buffering the results and using the underlying shell facilities

## Description
This example illustrates how invoke an external application using `exec`, which buffers the results as `execFile` does, but also executes the command into a shell, so that things such as *pipes*, *redirects* and *backgounding* are available. 

When using `exec`, the provided callback is invoked when the subshell exits, and it receives the buffered results for `stdout` and `stderr`. 

In Node.js, the `child_process` module allows you to execute other applications (including Node applications).
It provides 4 different async methods that are intended for different scenarios:
+ `execFile` &mdash; execute an external application, given a set of arguments, and callback with the buffered output after the process exits.
+ `spawn` &mdash; execute an external application, given a set of arguments, and provide a streaming interface for I/O and events for when the process exits.
+ `exec` &mdash; execute one or more commands inside a shell an callback with the buffered output after the process exits.
+ `fork` &mdash; execute a Node module as a separate process, given a set of arguments, provide a streaming and eventd interface like `spawn` and also set up an inter-process communication (IPC) channel between the parent and child process.
