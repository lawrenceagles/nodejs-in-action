> simple examples to illustrate `bind` and `apply`

## Description
The example illustrates two simple use cases in which `bind` and `apply` can be used.

+ `bind` &mdash; creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.
+ `apply` &mdash; calls a function with a given `this` value, and arguments provided as an array.
+ `call` &mdash; same as `apply` but arguments are provided individually.
