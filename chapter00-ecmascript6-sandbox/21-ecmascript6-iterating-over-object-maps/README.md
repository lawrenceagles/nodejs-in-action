> illustrates how to use ES6 iterators to iterate over Object Maps as Key-Value Pairs

## Description
The ES6 iterator protocol can be used to turn regular ES6 objects into iterable sequences. In this example, it is illustrated how to iterate over key-value maps using the iterator.

In the example it is demonstrated how to wrap a regular key-value object map into an object that is iterable, so that you can use the *spread operator* and the `for..of` construct to get elements from the sequence.
