### Description
The function `scheduleMeeting()` takes a start time in 24-hour format as a string `'hh:mm'` and a meeting duration (number of minutes) and returns `true` if the meeting falls entirely within the work day (as specified by `dayStart` and `dayEnd`), and false if the meeting falls outside of the workday bounds.
