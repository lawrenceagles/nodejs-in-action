> introducing ES6 template strings

## Description
Illustrates how to use template strings in ES6 to insert values in strings. This feature works for single and multi-line strings, and it should be preferred over using concatenation, as the syntax is cleaner.

```javascript
console.log(`An exception was caught: ${error}`);
```
