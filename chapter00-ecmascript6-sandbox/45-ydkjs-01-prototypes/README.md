> A refresher on prototypes

### Prototypes
The *prototype* concept can be rationalized as a linkage between two objects. This linkage is established when an object *B* is created to another object *A* that already exists.

A series of objects linked together via prototypes is called the *prototype chain*.

The purpose of this linkage from *B* to *A* is to enable *B* to invoke the properties and methods that *B* do not feature to *A*. Therefore, the prototype mechanism can be seen as a *delegation* on which two or more objects cooperate to perform a task.

You can establish the prototype of an object using `Object.create()`:

```javascript
const aObj = {
  prop1: 'value1',
  fn1: fn1() { ... }
}
const bObj = Object.create(aObj);
```

All objects will ultimately have `Object.prototype` as their prototype (which provides built-in methods such as `toString()`, `valueOf()`, etc.). 

You can create a standalone object (that is, one that does not have any prototype) by using `Object.create(null)`.

As you might expect in a delegation relationship, the properties that you defined on *B* having the same name as the ones defined on *A* will shadow the ones from *A*.
