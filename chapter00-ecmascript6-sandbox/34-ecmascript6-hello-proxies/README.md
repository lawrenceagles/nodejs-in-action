> introduction to ES6 proxies

## Description
Illustrates the basic use of ES6 proxies:
+ Add validation rules on plain old JavaScript objects, and enforce them
+ Keep track of every interaction that goes through the proxy
+ Implement your own observable objects
+ Decorate and extend objects without changing their implementation
+ Make certain properties on an object completely invisible to consumers
+ Revoke access at will when the consumer should no longer be able to access an object
+ Modify the arguments passed to an object
+ Modify the result produced by a proxied object
+ Prevent deletion of specific properties through the proxy
+ Prevent new definitions from succeeding, according to the desired property descriptor
+ Shuffle arguments around in a constructor
+ Return a result other than the object created vian `new`
+ Swap out the prototype of an object for something else
