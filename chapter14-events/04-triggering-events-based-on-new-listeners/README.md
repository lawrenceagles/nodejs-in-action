> listening on `newListener` to trigger events

## Description
A more involved example about `newListener` event, on which we create a class that detects when a new listener is established on a `"pulse"` event. When that event (*new listener for `pulse`*) is detected, the example starts sending events of type `"pulse"` as initially configured.
