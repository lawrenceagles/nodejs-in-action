> Express-based Node.js microservice subject of being deployed to SAP Cloud Foundry

## Description

This example illustrates how to deploy the simplest *Express* application to SAP Cloud Foundry.
The following endpoint is defined: `/api/heartbeat`.

## Configuration
Authentication in the SAP CF environment is provided by the UAA service. In this example, *OAuth 2.0* is used as the authentication mechanism.

This section describes the procedure to enable authentication in an Express-based, Node.js application:

1. A file `./xsuaa/xs-security.json` is created with the following contents:
```json
{
  "xsappname": "sap-cf-microservice",
  "tenant-mode": "dedicated"
}
```

2. A service instance of type `xsuaa` is created with the name `sap-cf-microservice-xsuaa`:
```bash
cf create-service xsuaa application sap-cf-microservice-xsuaa -c xsuaa/xs-security.json
```

3. The service is then added in the `manifest.yml` to advertise the binding between our microservice and the recently created *xsuaa service*. Note that it is also added as an environment variable for convenience purposes too.
```yaml
---
applications:

- name: sap-cf-microservice
  buildpacks:
    - nodejs_buildpack
  
  instances: 1
  memory: 128M
  disk_quota: 250M

  services:
  - sap-cf-microservice-xsuaa

  env:
    xsuaa-instance: sap-cf-microservice-xsuaa
```

4. The next step consists in setting up your *Express* application to use *Passport* and the *JWT* strategy provided by the `@sap/xssec` module. In the example, those concerns are addressed by the `authenticator.js` module. 
```javascript

// Middleware configuration
const passport = require('passport');
const JWTStrategy = require('@sap/xssec').JWTStrategy;
...

passport.use(new JWTStrategy(xsenv.getServices({ uaa: xsuaaInstance }).uaa));
passport.initialize();

// Securing the endpoints
app.get('/api/heartbeat', api.heartbeat); // anyone can call this endpoint
app.get('/api/greetme/:name?', authenticator.secureEndpoint(), api.greetMe); // secured endpoint
```

5. The authenticator includes logic to automatically disable authentication when running locally, so you can try accessing the defined endpoints after running `npm start`. When running on SAP Cloud Foundry environment, you will need to obtain a bearer token to access the secured endpoints:
    1. Obtain the client id, client secret and authentication endpoint url by running:
    ```bash
    $ cf env sap-cf-microservice
    System-Provided:
    {
    "VCAP_SERVICES": {
      "xsuaa": [
      {
        "binding_name": null,
        "credentials": {
        "clientid": "<the-client-id>",
        "clientsecret": "<the-client-secret>",
        ...
        "url": "<the-authentication-endpoint>",
        "verificationkey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...
    ```

    2. Send an HTTP request to the authentication endpoint to obtain the JWT token:
    ```bash
    curl -v -X POST \
    --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    -G \
    --data-urlencode "grant_type=password" \
    --data-urlencode "client_id=<the-client-id>" \
    --data-urlencode "client_secret=<the-client-secret>" \
    --data-urlencode "username=<your-SAP-CF-username>" \
    --data-urlencode "password=<your-SAP-CF-password>" \
    <the-authentication-endpoint>/oauth/token
    ```
    If the request is successful, you will obtain a JSON that contains a property `access_token` that you can use to access the secure endpoints.

    3. Send a request for the secured endpoint. The request must include the access token in the *authorization header* as described below:
    ```bash
    curl --verbose \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --header "Accept: application/json" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer <the-access-token-from-the-previous-step> \
    https://sap-cf-microservice.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/api/greetme/inma
    ```
