> file locking mechanism as a module

## Description
The example illustrates how to create a module that implements a file-locking mechanism as a module, that would prevent concurrent access to a given file. 

Note that the mechanism only works for a given file, and that the location of the locks is somewhat arbitrary.

However, with the example you get a sense as the tasks involved in such operations.
