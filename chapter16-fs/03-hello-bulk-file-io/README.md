> introducing Node.js file bulk API

## Description
Illustrates how to read the contents of a file in a bulk operation that will materialize the whole contents of the file in a buffer.

Obviously, that is not an appropriate technique for really large files.

The example illustrate how to use the API with callbacks, Promises and async/await.
