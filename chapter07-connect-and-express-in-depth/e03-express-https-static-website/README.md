# e03-express-https-static-website

> *Express* application that exposes a static website through HTTPS

## Application Description

In this project we build the an Express based server that can be used to expose an static or JavaScript based website. The most relevant part of this exercise is the configuration of the security certificates to use HTTPS. 

The following steps will be followed:
1. Generate a key for the *root SSL certificate*
2. Create the *root SSL certificate*
3. Create the *CSR (certificate signing request)*, also known as the *server key*
4. Create the *server certificate*
5. Configure the *Express application* with server certificate and server key (CSR)
6. Test 1, accepting browser security warnings
7. Install the *root SSL certificate* into Ubuntu's system certificate store
8. Configure *Chrome* browser with *root SSL certificate*



### Step 1: Generating a key for the *root SSL certificate*

In this step, we generate a private key that will be used in the creation of the *root SSL certificate*. As this key is not specifically linked with this application, it is recommended to create it and keep it separate from the application you want to secure with HTTPS.

Therefore, you should type:

```bash
# create and cd to a directory not linked with the Express app
mkdir -p ~/Development/https-resources
cd ~/Development/https-resources

# generate an AES256, 2048 bits long key for the root SSL certificate
$ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out rootCA.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
.....................................................................................................................................................+++
...................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for rootCA.key:   # <- type a password
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for rootCA.key:  # <- retype previous password
```

### Step 2: Create the *root SSL certificate*

In this step, we create the root SSL certificate. This will be used as a self-signed CA, used to validate the server certificate(s) we use.

```bash
# create root SSL certificate using previously generated key
# -nodes: don't encrypt the private key
# -days: override the default validity with the given number
$ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem
Enter pass phrase for rootCA.key: # <- the password used for the key in the prev step
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:.
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:.
Locality Name (eg, city) []:.
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:.
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:.
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Self-Signed Local CA Certificate  # <- this will be used to identify the cert later on
Email Address []:sergio.f.gonzalez@gmail.com # <- same as above
```

At this point, you will have the key and certificate for your local CA:
```bash
$ cd ~/Development/https-resources
$ ls -la
total 16
drwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Mar 14 16:10 .
drwxrwxr-x 4 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Mar 14 15:58 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1766 Mar 14 16:00 rootCA.key
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1277 Mar 14 16:10 rootCA.pem
```

### Step 3: Create the *CSR (certificate signing request)*, also known as the *server key*

In this step we will generate the server key, that is, the private part of the keypair that will be installed on the server application to enable HTTPS. For this reason, the *Express* application will need access to this key, so you might want to place it under the `./app/src/certs` or a similar directory.
However, it is also possible to use the same self-signed certificate for different applications running on the same development environment, so you can also create it in `~/Development/https-resources` with the other system-level certificates. 
We will use the latter approach.

Note also that, in general, the generated key should not be distributed or committed into the repo. However, this is self-signed key intented for development, so no harm done even if you commit it.

To create the *server key* we will first create a `server.csr.cnf` file that will alleviate many of the manual inputs for the subsequent command.
```
# server.csr.cnf

[req]
default_bits = 2048
prompt = no
default_md = sha256
distinguished_name = dn

[dn]
CN = localhost
emailAddress = sergio.f.gonzalez@gmail.com
```

Now we're ready to create the actual *server key*:
```bash
# create the certificate signing request (CSR), also referred to as server key
$ openssl req -new -sha256 -nodes -out server.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -config <(cat server.csr.cnf)
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
.............+++
.......................................+++
writing new private key to 'server.key'
-----
```

### Step 4: Create the *server certificate*

In this step we generate the *X509 v3 certificate*, that is, the public part of the keypair that will be installed on the server application to enable HTTPS. For this reason, the *Express* application will need access to this certificate, so you might want to place it under the `./app/src/certs` or a similar directory.
If you intend to use the same cert for several locally hosted applications, you can create the cert in the same `~/Development/https-resources` we've been using and copy it later to the HTTPS-enabled application.


Note also that, in contrast to the server key, the generated key can be distributed and committed into the repo. 

First of all, we need to create a file with the configuration information for the *X509 v3 certificate* that we will use afterwards:

```
# v3.ext

authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost
```

Note that only localhost is added. If (like me) you use VMs for local development you might be tempted to add the VMs IP addresses to the *alt_names*. However, that does not work.

Then, we can proceed to create the *server certificate*:
```bash
$ openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial \
-out server.crt -days 1024 -sha256 -extfile v3.ext
Signature ok
subject=/CN=localhost/emailAddress=sergio.f.gonzalez@gmail.com
Getting CA Private Key
Enter pass phrase for rootCA.key: # <- type the password configured in step 1
```

### Step 5: Configure the *Express application* with server certificate and server key (CSR)

Now we're ready to start testing our *HTTPS-enabled Express* application.
The first thing we should do, is copy the *server certificate* and *server key* to a directory within the application sources, for example `./app/src/certs`.

![HTTPS artifacts](./doc_images/https-artifacts-on-app.png)

The main pieces of the Express configuration are:
+ Enable and configure the [*Helmet*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) middleware in `index.js`
+ Configure HTTPS on the `www` module, ensuring that the certificate and server key are read from the configuration

Once this is completed, you can type:
```bash
$ npm start
  express-static:index Application running with env = development +0ms
  express-static:index Application running with NODE_ENV = undefined +2ms
  express-static:wwww Listening on Port 8443 +0ms
```

### Step 6: Test, accepting browser security warnings

In this step, we will use *Chrome* to validate that we can access the application locally using HTTPS (or remotely, if the server is hosted on a VM, for example), by accepting the security warnings presented to use by the browser.

So, when accessing https://localhost:8443 we will see:
![Chrome Privacy Warning](./doc_images/chrome-privacy-warning.png)

But you will be able to click on *Advanved* and *Proceed to localhost* to access the HTTPS enabled website:
![Chrome Proceed to localhost](./doc_images/chrome-privacy-warning-proceed.png)

And the static web page will be displayed:
![Unsecured localhost app](./doc_images/unsecured-https-enabled-application.png)

At this point, you might be satisfied enough, but we will go the extra mile and configure the self-signed root CA on the system certificate store and in Chrome, so that you no longer receive the security warnings.

### Step 7: Install the *root SSL certificate* into the Ubuntu's system certificate store

Installing the *root SSL certificate* in Ubuntu's certificate store will help the applications that rely on that store to validate server certificates, so it's a good thing to do.

The procedure has been tested on *Ubuntu 16.04*:
```bash
# Installing the CA
$ sudo cp ~/Development/https-resources/rootCA.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/rootCA.crt

# Refresh the certs store
$ sudo update-ca-certificates
Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
1 added, 0 removed; done.
Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...
done.
```
After that step, there are a couple of things you can do to validate that everything is going well:
+ Check that the copied certificate has been added to the chain in `ca-certificates.crt`
+ Use openssl to obtain detailed information from the server

For the first validation type:
```bash
# Checking
$ cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
...

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

You can check that the last entry in the file matches the contents of our `rootCA.pem`.

The second verification is much more elaborate and requires the server to be running. It consists on an *OpenSSL* command that actually interacts with the server as the browser would do and returns the HTTPS related information:

```bash
# start the server
$ npm start

$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:5000 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs
CONNECTED(00000003)
depth=1 CN = Self-Signed Local CA Certificate, emailAddress = sergio.f.gonzalez@gmail.com
verify return:1

```

In this output you can see how the correct certificate has been identified and all the return codes are successful.

The same type of output you'd get for `127.0.0.1:8443`.

### Step 8: Install the *root SSL certificate* into Chrome's certificate store

If we try again to access https://localhost:8443 from the browser we will see that we still get the same security warning as before, but that can be easily fixed by installing the *root SSL certificate* `rootCA.pem` generated on [step 2](#step-2-create-the-root-ssl-certificate).

To do that, open Chrome Settings, type *Manage Certificates* and Import the *server.crt* file:
[Chrome settings](./doc_images/chrome-settings.png)
[Manage certificates](./doc_images/chrome-settings-certs.png)

Then, you just have to import the self-signed root SSL certificate into Chrome:
[Import CA certificate](./doc_images/chrome-settings-certs-ca-import.png)
[Import CA certificate2](./doc_images/chrome-settings-certs-ca-import-cert.png)
[Import CA certificate3](./doc_images/chrome-settings-certs-ca-import-cert-options.png)
[Import CA certificate4](./doc_images/chrome-settings-certs-ca-import-cert-done.png)

Once completed the configuration, you can try again to access https://localhost:8443 and you will see the green lock on the toolbar!
[Secured HTTPS](./doc_images/chrome-local-secure.png)
