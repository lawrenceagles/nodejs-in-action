# 01-hello-express
> creates the simplest `express` HTTP server

## Description
Illustrates how to create the simplest HTTP server using the `express` module. The application uses waterfall configuration and a logging framework.

### Additional info
The project can be used as a template for all *Express* based projects. It includes the `config` custom module and lists `express` and `log4js` as dependencies.
As the `config` module is not published in *NPM*, config dependencies `nconf` and `js-yaml` are also added in the `package.json`.
