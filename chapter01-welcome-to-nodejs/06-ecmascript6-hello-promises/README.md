> promises in Node.js

## Description
The most simple example of promises in Node.js. In the example, a synchronous promise is created that is fulfilled if a random number between 0 and 1 is less than 0.5, or fails otherwise. The syntax for using `then(onSuccess, onReject)` and the alternative `then(onSuccess).catch(onFail)` are used.
