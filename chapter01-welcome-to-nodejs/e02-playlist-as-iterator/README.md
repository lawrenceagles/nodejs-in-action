# e02-playlist-as-iterator
> using ES6 iterators to build a playlist

## Description
Illustrates the use of the ES6 iterator protocol in a sample scenario involving a song playlist.

In the example, we use iterators to provide the following functionality to a playlist:
+ repeat the playlist once done a given number of times
+ repeat the playlist indefinitely
+ repeat the playlist shuffling the songs
