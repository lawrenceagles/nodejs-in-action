> using ES6 classes in Node.js

## Description
Illustrates how to use ES6 classes in Node.js. 

In the program several class samples are used:

### pre-ES6 vs. ES6 class management
The Rabbit example from Eloquent JavaScript is written in both prototype and ES6 class notation.

### ES6 advanced class handling
A more comprehensive example involving a Fruit class is defined with a constructor and several methods. It is demonstrated:
+ how to define the class constructor
+ how to define the class methods
+ how to create new instances with new
+ how to create class factories by creating expressions that return classes.
+ how to create instance setters and getters
+ how to create static methods in classes
+ how to create static properties (discouraged)
+ how to leverage `extends` and `super` for class inheritance

### Pre-ES6 inheritances
Illustrates how to leverage `Object.create` and Node's `util.inherits` to provide the same kind of behavior that the new capabilities for class inheritance.
