> introducing the different features available for os integration

## Description
The example illustrates some of the os integration features:
+ getting architecture information with `process.arch`
+ getting memory usage with `process.memoryUsage`
+ getting arguments received from the command-line using `process.argv`
+ exiting a program with a given exit code using `process.exit`
+ obtaining the OS process ID with `process.pid`
+ listening OS signals such as `SIGHUP`, `SIGTERM`, ... with `process.on` (hint: use CTRL+C to send SIGINT)
