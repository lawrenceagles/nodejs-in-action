> defining the fundamental principles and concepts of Functional Programming

### Intro
This section delves into how functional programming influences the design of data structures and algorithms.

Functional programming provide a core set of common data structures with *combinator* operations that are very powerful for working with data: emphasis is given to a declarative structure, immutable values and side-effects-free functions.

### Lists

A *List* is an *Algebraic Data Type* with structural similarities to the `Option` type. In both cases, a common interface defines the protocol of the type, and there are two concrete subtypes: one that represents an *empty* list, and one that represents a *non-empty* list.
