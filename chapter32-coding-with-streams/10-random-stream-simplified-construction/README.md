### 10 &mdash; `RandomStream`: a random string generator as a stream, simplified construction
> illustrates how to implement a custom *readable* stream by using the fimplified construction approach. The example creates a stream `RandomStream` that produces random strings, and then we consume from `RandomStream` using the *non-flowing* and *flowing* mode.
