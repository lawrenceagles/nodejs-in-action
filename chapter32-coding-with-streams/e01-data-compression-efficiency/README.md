### Exercise 1 &mdash; Data compression efficiency
> Write a command-line script that takes a file as input and compresses it using the different algorithms available in the `zlib` module (Brotli, Deflate, Gzip). As an output, write a table that compares the algorithm's compression time and efficiency on the given file. Hint: this could be a good use case for the *fork pattern*, provided that you're aware of its performance considerations.
