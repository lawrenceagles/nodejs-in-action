> most basic example using Koa 2 HTTP server library

The term framework is overloaded and means different things to different people. In Node.js you can call any framework *module* and you will never get it wrong.

However, it's a good thing to establish some basic concepts:

+ **API Framework** &mdash; a library for building web APIs, backed by a framework that helps to structure the application.
+ **HTTP server library** &mdash; libraries that help you build applications that are based around HTTP verbs and routes (anything based on Express falls into this category).
+ **HTTP server framework** &mdash; a framework for building modular servers that speak HTTP.
+ **Web MVC framework** &mdash; model-view-controller frameworks
+ **Full-stack framework** &mdash; a library that uses JavaScript on both the server and the browser and are able to share code between both ends.


## Description
Koa is an HTTP server library, which means it is a library that helps you build applications that are based around HTTP verbs and routes. Anything based on Express falls into this category.

In the example, we write the simplest HTTP server using Koa 2 (which by the way, no longer uses generators).

Koa 2 library uses middleware that is invoked in a particular way.
Let's consider the example:

```javascript
// Middleware 1
app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  const start = new Date();
  await next();
  const ms = new Date() - start;
  ctx.set("X-Response-Time", `${ ms } msec`);
});

// Middleware 2
app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  const start = new Date();
  await next();
  const ms = new Date() - start;
  console.log(`Method=${ ctx.method } URL=${ ctx.url } duration: ${ ms } msec`);
});

// Middleware 3
app.use(ctx => {
  ctx.body = "Hello, world";
});
```

That code responds with a simple "Hello, world", however the request flow is as follows:
+ When a middleware invokes `next()` the function suspends and passes control to the next middleware defined
+ When there's no more middleware to execute, the stack will unwind and each middleware is resumed to perform its upstream behavior

Therefore, that is what happens:
+ Middleware 1 is executed until `next()` is called
+ Middleware 2 is executed until `next()` is called
+ Middleware 3 is executed until the end, because it's not invoking `next()`
+ Middleware 2 execution is resumed
+ Middleware 1 execution is resumed
